# Advent of Code 2023 - Rust Solutions

Welcome to my repository for the [Advent of Code 2023 event](https://adventofcode.com/)! This repository contains my solutions to the daily coding puzzles from December 1st to December 25th. I've decided to use Rust for this year's event as a way to learn and improve my skills in the language.

## Table of Contents

- [Getting Started](#getting-started)
- [Running the Solutions](#running-the-solutions)
- [Project Structure](#project-structure)
- [Notes](#notes)

## Getting Started

To explore the solutions, simply navigate to the corresponding day's folder. Each day's solution is contained within its own Rust project directory.

## Running the Solutions

For each day, you can run the solution using the following commands:

```bash
cd day-01      # Change to the day's directory
cargo run    # Run the solution using Cargo
```

Make sure you have Rust and Cargo installed on your machine before running the solutions.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized by days, with each day having its own dedicated directory (day1, day2, ..., day25). Within each day's directory, you'll find the Rust source code, and any other necessary resources.
